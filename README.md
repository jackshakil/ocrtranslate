# ocrtranslate

A proof-of-concept (POC) system that can recognise and read words from a primary textbook
is what this project wants to create. The POC will recognise and extract text from photos of
elementary textbooks using computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR)
technology.

The system will go through a number of steps, such as image preprocessing, text detection,
character recognition, and translation of the list of words. The primary textbook photos will
first undergo preprocessing in order to improve the image quality and get rid of any noise or
distortions. The machine will then identify the text-containing portions in the image and crop
those areas to extract individual characters. Once each character has been identified, OCR
methods will be used to merge them into a word.

The Python programming language and open-source libraries Tesseract and OpenCV will be
used to construct the POC, and the Google translate API will be used for translation from
source language to the desired language.
